# ML-Project-Enefit
This is a machine learning project (and a kaggle competition) that aims to build an energy prediction model; for reducing the imbalance costs due to the increasing number of prosumers. Detail description can be found: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-energy-behavior-of-prosumers
